# Paris-Saclay OHP Summer School 2023

## America / Pelican challenge

Our objective will be to build collectively images of the [NGC 7000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America_Nebula) / [IC 5070 / IC 5067](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Nebule) complex, *a.k.a.* the North America and Pelican nebulae. We will acquire and reduce the date necessary to produce an image in 'natural' RGB colors (similar to the one below, but at higher resolution) and in 'false color' narrow band (SII, H&#0945;, OII, similar to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America_Nebula#/media/File:NANeb3PS23_SCNR.jpg)).

**The challenge will be to collectively accumulate as many hours of exposure as possible to assemble the best final images**.

Beyond making pretty pictures, our objective will be to understand the data acquisition chain and the calibration process. This will be performed using a [refracting telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refracting_telescope), a camera and filters, all commercially available. . We will measure the physical properties of the [CMOS sensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active-pixel_sensor), understand the sources of noise in the data, and derive the optimum acquisition parameters. The principles and methods exposed are generic and applicable to amateur equipment and professional giant telescopes alike.

### 1.3 Notes

#### 1.3.1 Plate scale

Given the pixel size of 3.76 &#0956;m, and the measured focal length of the telescope is 555 mm (larger than the listed value by 1%), the plate scale of the setup is 

3600 * &#0960; atan( 0.00376 / 555 ) / 180 = 1.397" / pixel

#### 1.3.2 Angular resolution

The angular resolution is given by the diameter of the [Airy disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airy_disk)

r = 1.22 &#0955; / D

with D = 0.1 m the diameter of the objective lens. In the green, this corresponds to about 1.1". However, the typical seeing (from atmospheric turbulence) is about 2" to 3" rms, which thus drives the resolution. In addition, the tracking errors of the equatorial mount are of the order of 1" rms. Taking the quadratic sum of the three contributors, we get the effective width of the [Point Spread Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_spread_function) (PSF).

| Filter   | &#0955; [nm] | Optical r ["] | 2" seeing r ["] | 3" seeing r ["] |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| B        | 460          | 0.94          | 2.43            | 3.30            |
| OIII     | 496 / 501    | 1.02 / 1.03   | 2.46 / 2.46     | 3.32 / 3.33     |
| G        | 530          | 1.09          | 2.49            | 3.35            |
| R        | 640          | 1.32          | 2.60            | 3.43            |
| H&#0945; | 656          | 1.35          | 2.61            | 3.44            |
|SII       | 672          | 1.38          | 2.63            | 3.45            |

While the optical resolution values differ by 30%, the effective resolution varies by 8% with 2" seeing and by 4% with 3". At 2" seeing, the system does not satisfy the
[Nyquistâ€“Shannon sampling theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem), which requires a sampling of 1.2" / pixel in the blue. 

#### 1.3.3 Tracking

The equatorial mount is tracking very accurately, with compensation of the periodic error down to ~1" rms. However, there is no active guiding. This means that long exposures will be affected by drift caused by polar alignment errors. The measured drift rate is typically 0.5" / minute. If we allow a total drift during an exposure to be 1/10th the PSF (so that the effect is negligible), the exposure time is limited to 30 s with 2" seeing.

## 2. The acquisition chain

The signal S(**x**) measured in DN (Digital Number, *a.k.a.* ADU, Analog to Digital Unit) by the detector is equal to

S(**x**) = g(**x**) * [ t * ( Q(**x**, &#0955;) * I(**x**) + N(**x**, T) ) + R(**x**) ] + B(**x**)

where:
- **x** is the vector position on the detector.
- &#0955; is the wavelength.
- I(**x**) is the intensity incident on the detector, in photons per second.
- Q(**x**, &#0955;) is the [external quantum efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_efficiency) (EQE), *i.e.* the number of photo-electrons created per incident photon.
- g(**x**) is the gain of the detector, *i.e.* the number of DN per photo-electron.
- N(**x**, T) is the thermal signal, function of the temperature T, in electrons per second.
- t is the exposure time, in seconds.
- R(**x**) is the read noise, in electrons.
- B(**x**) is the bias of the Analog to Digital Converter(s) (ADC), *i.e.* the output value that corresponds to zero incident intensity, in DN per electron. The bias is set to a positive value to avoid clipping of faint signals to zero.

It is important to note that for a given pixel, I(**x**), N(**x**, T) and R(**x**) are functions of time because of the statistical fluctuations of the photon and thermal signals, and because of the noise in the readout electronics. I, N and R must thus be understood as random variables. It is worth noting that thermal electrons cannot be distinguished from photo-electrons. They obey to the same [Poisson statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution).

The above equation can be rewritten:

S(**x**) = g(**x**) * [ t * Q(**x**) * I(**x**) + R(**x**) ] + g(**x**) * t * N(**x**, T) + B(**x**)

The relevant quantity to compute the [shot noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_noise) in the image is E(**x**) = EQE(x) * I(x), *i.e.* the number of electrons, which is what is effectively counted by the sensor. We thus have 

S(**x**) = g(**x**) * [ t * E(**x**) + R(**x**) ] + g(**x**) * t * N(**x**, T) + B(**x**)

The objective of the calibration of the detector is to invert the above equation to be able to determine E(**x**) knowing the measured signal S(**x**). As mentioned above, N and R are random variables. As such, it is impossible to know the exact value taken by each one during a given data acquisition. All we can determine - and correct for - is the mean (denoted <>) of these random variables. In addition, we note that the read noise R(**x**) has zero mean. We can thus now write the calibration equation as 

E(**x**) = { S(*x**) - [ g(**x**) * t * < N >(**x**, T) + B(**x**) ] } / [ g(**x**) * t ]

or, with D(**x**) = g(**x**) * t * < N >(**x**, T) + B(**x**)

E(**x**) = [ S(*x**) - D(**x**) ] / [ g(**x**) * t ]


- D(**x**), sum of the thermal signal and [bias](bias.ipynb), can be measured by taking '[dark frames](darks.ipynb)', *i.e.* images taken without illuminating the detector.

- The gain g(**x**) and read noise R(**x**) can be measured simultaneously using a method called the [Photon Transfer Curve (PTC)](ptc.ipynb) analysis. Although the read noise does not appear in the calibration equation, it is an important quantity to determine to choose the optimal acquisitaion parameters and to reduce the data.  

- The PTC analysis will typically provide the mean value of the gain over the detector. The pixel-to-pixel variations of the gain g(**x**) are called the '[flat-field](flats.ipynb)' and can be measured using a uniform light source. By extension, the term flat-field is used to describe the combination of all the multiplicative terms that affect the spatial variations of the response of the instrument (*e.g.* the [vignetting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vignetting)).  

## 3. Choosing the optimal acquisition parameters

### 3.1 Bias

The bias value of the ADC needs to be chosen so that the value are not This will be looked at in the [bias notebook](bias.ipynb). 

### 3.2 Gain

Looking at the characteristics of the [ZWO ASI 2600 MM Cool](https://astronomy-imaging-camera.com/manuals/ASI2600_Manual_EN.pdf), the gain setting of 100 is a good compromise between dynamic range and read noise. Note that this 'gain' value of 100 is *not* the gain as defined above. It is a setting value in arbitrary units, to which corresponds a true gain (as expressed in DN / electron), as measured in the [ptc](ptc.ipynb) notebook.

### 3.3 Exposure time

Deep sky objects require long exposures, typically several hours. One could either take a single very long exposure, or take multiple shorter exposures and sum (or stack) them up to the same equivalent total exposure time:

- A single frame is in theory the best in terms of noise (see below), but requires perfect guiding and will be ruined by trails from planes and satellites, and possibly by clouds.
- Stacking multiple images will result in more noise (see below), but guiding does not have to be as good, and trails can easily be removed in post-processing.

As we will see below, there is an objective way to determine the optimal exposure time for individual frames in the stack.

In a single frame, the variance of the noise is the sum of the variances of the read noise &#0963;_r and of the signal. Since the signal has Poisson statistics, its variance is t * (I + N), with t the exposure time and I and N respectively the photon and thermal signals, in electrons per second. When stacking (summing) n frames, the noises add quadratically and the variance in the resulting image is thus given by

&#0963;&#0178; = n * [ t * (I + N) + &#0963;_r&#0178; ]

We decompose the photon signal I as the sum of the signal A from the astronomical object of interest and of the [sky background brightness](sky.ipynb) K, and rewrite the above as

&#0963;&#0178; = n * t * A + n * [ t * (K + N) + &#0963;_r&#0178; ] 

The first term is the variance from the shot noise of the astronomical object, which depends only upon the total exposure time n * t. For that term, there is no difference between a single long exposure and several shorter ones.

The last two terms are the variance of the noises from the parasitic sources: read noise, sky background and thermal signal. With a cooled camera, the thermal noise can easily be negligible before the sky background. The ratio 

R = ( &#0963;_r&#0178; + t * K ) / ( t * K )

represents the noise relative to the ideal detector case (no read noise, no thermal noise). Interestingly, it does not depend upon the number of exposures. We can then define a maximum acceptable value for this ratio, so that 

R < (1 + &#0949;)&#0178;

with &#0949; representing the acceptable increase in noise, *e.g.* 0.1 for 10%. We then derive the corresponding exposure time

t = &#0963;_r&#0178; / { K * [ (1 + &#0949;)&#0178; - 1] }

Exposure times larger than that will only provide marginal reduction of the noise in the stack. For a given &#0949;, the optimum exposure time thus proportional to the ratio &#0963;_r&#0178; / K. The higher the read noise, the longer the required exposure time. The brighter the sky background, the shorter the required exposure time.

For example, for a read noise of 1.4 electrons, a [sky brightness](sky.ipynb) of 0.35 electrons, one gets

t = 27 s

for &#0949; = 0.1 (10% acceptable noise increase). This is to be compared with the maximum exposure time allowed by the tracking system (see [1.3.3](#Tracking)).
